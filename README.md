# 🖤 DigitalYesi Links

This repository contains the source code for my personal link-in-bio website — a custom-built homepage designed and coded by [@chaneldemonblaze](https://github.com/chaneldemonblaze).  
It includes my age gate, profile photo, and social media/OnlyFans links with a dark animated background and gamer-inspired theme.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- **index.html** – The first page that shows the 18+ verification.  
  Clicking **Enter** leads to the main page (`links.html`).
- **links.html** – The main page that includes the profile image, icons, and link buttons.
- **Animated Background** – The black/gray moving stripes are made using CSS animations.
- **Icons and Links** – Each icon and button uses an `<a>` tag that can be updated with new links at any time.
- **Responsive Layout** – Works on both phones and computers automatically.
